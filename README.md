# Screen Capture POC Documentation

## Introduction

This documentation outlines the Proof of Concept (POC) for capturing the screen using an Electron-Angular application. The POC demonstrates the integration of Electron with an Angular app, utilizing IPC (Inter-Process Communication) for communication between the main Electron process and the Angular renderer process.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js and npm installed.
- Angular CLI installed.
- Basic knowledge of Electron and Angular.

## Technologies Used

- Electron: The framework used for creating the desktop application.
- Angular: The front-end framework for building the user interface.
- IPC (Inter-Process Communication): Used for communication between Electron's main process and Angular's renderer process.
- Electron service in Angular: A custom Angular service used for triggering events and passing data between components and Electron.

## Installation

To install and set up the Electron-Angular app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from [repository_url].
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.

## Running the App

To run the Electron-Angular app, execute the following command:

```shell
npm run electron-build
```

This command will start both the Angular development server and the Electron app.

## Screen Capture Feature

### Overview

The screen capture feature allows users to capture a screenshot of their screen and save it as an image file. It demonstrates the seamless integration of Electron's screen capturing capabilities with Angular's user interface.

### Implementation Details

#### Electron Implementation

- Electron's `desktopCapturer` module is used to capture the screen.
- IPC (Inter-Process Communication) is employed to communicate between the main Electron process and the Angular renderer process.

#### Angular Implementation

- An Electron service is created in Angular to facilitate communication with Electron.
- Angular components use this service to trigger events and send/receive data.

### How to Capture the Screen

1. Open the Electron-Angular app.
2. Navigate to the screen capture section within the app.
3. Click the "Capture Screen" button.
4. Electron captures the screen and sends the image data to the Angular component.
5. The Angular component displays the captured image.
6. Users can save the image as a file using the provided interface.

### Screenshots

[Include screenshots or GIFs illustrating the screen capture feature in action.]

## Testing

The screen capture feature has been thoroughly tested to ensure its functionality. Testing scenarios include:

- Capturing screens with different resolutions.
- Handling multiple screens.
- Saving captured images with various file formats.

The testing results confirm the successful implementation of the screen capture feature.

## Known Issues

There are no known issues or limitations with the screen capture feature at this time.

## Conclusion

The Screen Capture POC demonstrates the successful integration of Electron with Angular to capture screens and provides a foundation for further development. This feature can be expanded upon for use in various applications where screen capture is required.
